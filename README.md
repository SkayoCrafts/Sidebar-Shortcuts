## Overview

This plugin adds the functionality to add simple shortcut-links to the sidebar in the control panel of Craft CMS.  
This is useful for quick access to various plugins or other important stuff!
For example if you have a a settings page from plugin that you visit often, like "cage/settings/appearance", you can add a Shortcut to the sidebar and get there with just one simple click, instead of three!  

I originally made this plugin just for myself, as a little time-saver, but I found it so useful that I wanted to share it!

## Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

- [ ] Set the position of the shortcuts (top, bottom, above settings, ...)
- [ ] Define custom icons for the shortcuts (maybe?)
- [ ] Show different shortcuts for different roles (maybe?)
